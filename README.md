# Piecewise Linear Regression
A simple implementation of greedy PLR based on paper "Maximum error-bound Piecewise Linear Regression for online stream approximation" and the repo [PLR](https://github.com/RyanMarcus/plr)

Greedy PLR is much faster than the optimal PLR and does not produce too many extra segment than the optimal PLR. I guess it is more applicable to latency-critical senarios.
